# check-key

This tool allows a given Windows product key to be validated.
It also contains code to recover a product key when some digits are unknown.

I built this tool because I managed to damage my Windows product key sticker to the
point where it was no longer fully readable.

Most of the digits were readable, two I was pretty sure of and one I had no idea.
After looking about on the web for a bit I managed to cobble together this tool
to validate a Windows key.

Using this tool I was able to recover my Windows product key in about 5 minutes.
Hopefully this tool can be of some use to others in a similar situation.

**NOTE:** this tool only works on a modern Windows machine (tested on Windows 11) as it uses the Windows built-in key checker.
